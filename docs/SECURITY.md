## Best Practices

As a coding agent with shell access, OpenClaude should be used with care:
- **Use in Trusted Environments**: Only run OpenClaude in directories you trust.
- **Review Tool Calls**: Always review and approve sensitive tool calls (like `Bash` or `FileWrite`) if you are not running in a sandboxed environment.
- **Credential Management**: Never share your API keys or `auth.json` file.
